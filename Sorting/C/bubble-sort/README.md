# bubble-sort in C

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Worst-case performance: Ðž(n^2)

## Run on Linux & macOS

1. Compile `gcc bubble-sort.c -o bubble-sort`.
2. Run with using the ready made test `bubble-sort < test`.
